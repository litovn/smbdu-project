# Database Management Project
A course project on "Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data" presented to work with a database management system for the 2023/2024 academic year.
The goal is to choose a database technology (Neo4j, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch) and a dataset (with at least 20,000 data points) for analysis that will be imported into the chosen database, performing various queries, and presenting the findings in a structured report. 

The following repository was created to store the complete outcomes of the queries presented in the report.
